## Usage

To use CometConnect , follow these steps:

1. install the required library.
2. To compile the server use the following command
```bash
g++ mainserver.c -o server `pkg-config --libs --cflags opencv4` -pthread -lportaudio
```
3. To compile the client use the following command
```bash
g++ mainclient.c -o client `pkg-config --libs --cflags opencv4` -pthread -lportaudio
```
4. Give executable permission to client and server .the server should do the first move.
```bash
chmod +x client
chmod +x server
```
5. Usage of server and client
```bash 
./server <ip of server>
```
```bash
./client <ip of server>
```
6. Establish a P2P connection between peers using the provided functions.
7. Terminate the communication and release any allocated resources using the provided cleanup functions.
